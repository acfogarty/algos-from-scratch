Naive Bayes classifier for unlabelled ebook files

* reads labelled datafiles
* partitions into training and test sets
* trains Naive Bayes classifier
* flag to choose between probabilities and log probabilities
* flag to switch on/off Laplacian correction (dataset must be big enough!)
* flag to choose between calculating prior from training set or using uniform prior

Usage:

python classify-skl.py #uses scikit-learn
python classify-scratch.py #Naive Bayes from scratch

control variables (vocabulary size, train/test split fraction, flags for Laplacian correction, uniform prior, etc.) all hard-coded in .py files
